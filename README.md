## Overview

danbooru-ruby-grabber is a danbooru downloader â€” simple script which downloads images from danbooru.donmai.us, konachan.com, behoimi.org and yande.re. Support of any danbooru-powered site could be added easily.

## Usage

```
Usage: danbooru.rb [options] "tags"

Target:
    -b, --board BOARDNAME            Target board. Supported options: danbooru (default), konachan, behoimi, yandere
    -P, --pool POOL_ID               Pool ID (tags will be ignored)

Storage options:
    -s, --storage DIR                Storage mode (all images in one dir and symlinks in tagged dirs)
    -d, --directory BASE_DIR         Base directory to save images. By default it uses the same location as script
    -f, --filename PATTERN           Filename pattern. Supported options: id (default), md5, tags, url (old default)
    Note: `-f tags` could miss some files due to filesystems' filename length limitation.

Authentication:
    This is optional, but recommended since some boards block access without authentication.
    -u, --user USERNAME              Username
    -p, --password PASSWORD          Password (API Key for danbooru)

Tools:
    Ruby's file saver is used by default. You can change it using this options. `wget` or `curl` binaries should be available.
    -w, --wget                       Download using wget
    -c, --curl                       Download using curl

Limits:
    This option could be used multiple times with different limiters.
    -l, --limit LIMITER              Limiters in the following format: limiter=number. Supported limiters: pages, posts, per_page

Help:
    -h, --help                       Print a help message
```

## Notes

* To prevent duplicates files are stored using post id based filenames. You can change this behavior using `-f` option.

* Using `-f tags` could miss some files due to filesystems' filename length limitation.

* Always use `-u` and `-p` options with danbooru, because they block requests without login and password.

* Number of tags you can use at the same time could be limited by board (for example danbooru limits basic accounts by 2 tags)

* Images are stored in tag-named directory.

* Script creates file named `files.bbs` with all tags of each image.

## Installation

You need json and nokogiri gems to be installed. You can install them by this command:

`gem install json nokogiri`

Note: may be you need to use `sudo`.

## Bonus

Have fun.
